# Counterfeit detection


The task in this assignment is to detect the  counterfeit banknotes. The data set is based on [banknote authentication Data Set ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication#) from UCI Machine Learning repository. The first three columns denote different parameters obtained from the photographs of the banknotes and last colum provides the label. Frankly as the dataset does not have any description I don't know  which labels corresponds to real and which to counterfeited banknotes. let's assume that label one (positive) denotes the clounterfeits. The set  [banknote_authentication.csv](./data/banknote_authentication.csv) can be found in the `data`  directory.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy.stats as st
```

```{python}
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, ConfusionMatrixDisplay
```

```{python}
import  matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize']=(8,8)
```

Please insert you  firstname  and name below

```{python}
import scrapbook as sb
```

```{python}
from  sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
seed = 31287
```

```{python}
data = pd.read_csv('data/banknotes_data.csv')
```

```{python}
data.head()
```

```{python tags=c("skip")}
data.describe()
```

```{python tags=c("skip")}
data.info()
```

```{python}
data_train, data_test = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2, shuffle=True, stratify=data.loc[:,'counterfeit'], random_state=seed)
```

```{python}
lbls_train = data_train['counterfeit']
lbls_test = data_test['counterfeit']
```

```{python}
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,4, figsize=(22,5))
for i in range(4):
    ax[i].hist(data_train[lbls_train==0].iloc[:,i], bins=32, histtype='step', color='blue')
    ax[i].hist(data_train[lbls_train==1].iloc[:,i], bins=32, histtype='step', color='red')
    ax[i].hist(data_train[lbls_train==0].iloc[:,i], bins=32, histtype='bar', color='lightblue', alpha=0.25)
    ax[i].hist(data_train[lbls_train==1].iloc[:,i], bins=32, histtype='bar', color='orange', alpha =0.25)
```

You will have to install a popular plotting library `seaborn`

```{python}
import seaborn
```

```{python}
seaborn.pairplot(data_train.iloc[:,0:5], hue='counterfeit');
```

## Problem 1


Using  the [GaussianNB](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB.html) function construct the  Gaussian  Bayes classifier using only one feature. Which feature will you choose? Calculate the confusion matrix (normalized as to show rates), ROC AUC score and plot ROC curve. Do this both for training and validation set. Plot both curves on the same plot.  

```{python}
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
```

__Hint__ For calculating metrics and plotting ROC curves you may use functions from scikit-learn: `roc_curve`, `roc_auc_score` and `confusion matrix`. For estimating normal distribution parameters  use `norm.fit` `from scipy.stats`. Use `norm.pdf` for normal probability density function.

```{python}
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, roc_curve, confusion_matrix
```

Which feature did you choose?


## Problem 2


Same as Problem 1 but now construct Gaussian Naive Bayes using two features. Additionally  compare ROC curve obtained with this and previous  classifier on the test set. What is the improvement of AUC score on the test set?

```{python}
gnb2.fit(data_train[features2], lbls_train)
```

## Problem 3

```{python active="", eval=FALSE}
Same as Problem 2 but now implement Gaussian Naive Bayes using all features. Show confusion matrix only for test set. Compare all three ROC curves on the test set, same with AUC score.
```

```{python}
n = 4
```

```{python}
gnba.fit(data_train[features_all], data_train['counterfeit'])
```
