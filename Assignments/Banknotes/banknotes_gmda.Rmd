# Counterfeit detection


The task in this assignment is to detect the  counterfeit banknotes. The data set is based on [banknote authentication Data Set ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication#) from UCI Machine Learning repository.  You have already used this set but this time I have removed  the first column. The set  `banknote_authentication.csv` can be found in the `data`  directory.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy.stats as st
```

<!-- #region tags=["skip"] -->
You will have to install a popular plotting library `seaborn`
<!-- #endregion -->

```{python}
data = pd.read_csv('data/banknote_authentication.csv' )
```

```{python}
data.head()
```

## Problem 


### A.


Perform the Quadratic Discriminant Analysis on this set. Calculate the confusion matrix, AUC score and plot the ROC curve. 


### B.


Perform Gaussian Mixture Discriminant Analysis on this set as described in the `gaussian_mixture_model_EM_algorithm` notebook. Use two components for positives and two components for negatives. Calculate the confusion matrix, AUC score and plot the ROC curve. 


### C.


Use k-fold cross validation to find the optimal number of gaussian components for each class. As before calculate the confusion matrix, AUC score and plot the ROC curve for the best classifier. Assume that maximal number of components in each class is 12.  


__Hint__ use the `StratifiedKFold` function from scikit-learn library to generate folds. 


## D.  


Assume that 1% of all the customers in your store try to pay with a counterfeit 100PLN bill. If you accept the counterfeit bill you loose 100PLN. If you reject a valid bill,  you may loose the purchase, you estimate this loss as 15PLN on average. For each of the three classifiers find the threshold that minimises your losses and calculates the minimum loss for each classifier. Show the optimal classifiers points on the ROC curves.
